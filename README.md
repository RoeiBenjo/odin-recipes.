Hello , in this project i will make a recipe website with a 3 or more diffrent recipes.
to make it work i will need to use a few skils of HTML :
1. making a home page for the site
2. making 3 diffrent webpages for 3 diffrent recipes.
3. using HTML commands to number the process of the recipe making .
4. adding photos of the final outcome .
Good luck <3
